# Hey

I am a product generalist a.k.a I can design, I can code, and I can manage products!

As a product engineer, I can work with the following tech stack; TypeScript, React, Next.js, Astro, Drizzle, Postgres, Supabase, Python and most other technologies with a good documentation.

As a product manager, I can work with the following tools: Figma, Excalidraw, Plane, BaseCamp, Most analytics tools. Apart from the tools, I bring quite a bit of velocity and simplify decisions for a faster GTM.

I have done a lot:

- Founded and scaled an educational platform with 1,500+ users and 20+ paying customers.
- Led product development for clients across the US, Singapore, and India.
- Drove product migrations and feature implementations at New Relic and HireHunch.
- Generated leads worth over 30 million INR through social strategies.

My technical foundation and product thinking make me particularly effective in these domains:

- Education Tech
- Content Creation & Media

- Healthcare Technology
- Talent Acquisition/HR Tech
- Developer Tools & Platforms
