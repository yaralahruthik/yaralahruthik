# Hey!

Currently, focusing on building educational products and content.

I can work across the stacks but the bulk of my knowledge is in the frontend department. 

I've found my niche in producing high-quality work rapidly, making me a valuable asset for early-stage ventures.

I run a [dev studio](https://www.withyhr.com/).

I am also a writer and a nature-based photographer. You'll find the links to the photographs and writings on [my website](https://iamyhr.com/).
