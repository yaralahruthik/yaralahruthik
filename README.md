I am always open to learning and working with new technologies, especially those with comprehensive documentation.

I love working on various projects to expand my skills and solve problems. Here are a couple of personal projects that I'm proud of:

When I'm not coding, you can find me learning new technologies, helping fellow developers, and contributing to online tech communities. Here are a few platforms where you can catch me:

- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/u/iamYHR/): I'm always striving to deepen my knowledge in software development. .

I am also a writer and a nature-based photographer. You'll find the links to the photographs and writings on my website.
